                            The newest developments in BI and analytics technologies have converged to create a new category called Decision Intelligence (DI). DI is defined as a framework that supports processes around data modeling, data discovery, business intelligence and information delivery into an integrated strategy and architecture. DI integrates artificial intelligence and machine learning to help businesses make more accurate and contextualized decisions faster. KASH Tech consultants have over 20 years of experience helping our clients develop the strategy and modern methodology that DI requires.  Our approach ensures that DI incorporates the latest technologies of AI and ML, and serves the disparate reporting, ad hoc data discovery, and information visualization needs within your Enterprise, and beyond to external customer and partners.

                            Self-service Reporting (BI) empowers teams such as product developers, sales, finance, marketing, operations, and customers to answer data questions, with appropriate governance supported by IT and BI analysts.  Self-service reporting provides autonomy in obtaining necessary information – it allows the user to build their own reports, rather than relying on those provided by a computer program, an I.T. department or a third party. And it is perhaps the single greatest tool utilized by any organization when it comes establishing a competitive advantage and growing your business.  Self-service Reporting forms the foundation for real-time analysis and decision making, fostering a proactive attitude across your organization. This new attitude will increase the velocity of your business and generate greater employee satisfaction.
