                                Our Onshore Model ensures that all the resources engaged in your project are localized.  This is especially important to organizations in industries where sourcing of resources are regulated, i.e., healthcare or government.  In our Onshore model our resource can be onsite at your facilities or work remotely to reduce travel costs associated with the project.  This model also offers the following advantages:

                                Our Hybrid model starts with our Onshore model but then replaces the actual development resources with offshore resources.  This ensures that your primary points of contact for the project are working the same business hours as your organization, while we gain the advantage of following the sun with development resources so development is happening around the clock if needed.  By having the Client-facing resources localized we ensure the highest level of communication and client contact required to ensure your success.  Additionally, these onshore resources are responsible for management of and communication with the offshore resources assigned to your project.  Our onshore resource facilitates the exchange of information with the offshore team and aggregates the offshore development into a seamless deliver to your environment.
