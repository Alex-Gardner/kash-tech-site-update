                                Our Hybrid model starts with our Onshore model but then replaces the actual development resources with offshore resources.  This ensures that your primary points of contact for the project are working the same business hours as your organization, while we gain the advantage of following the sun with development resources so development is happening around the clock if needed.

Our onshore resource facilitates the exchange of information with the offshore team and aggregates the offshore development into a seamless deliver to your environment.  This model also offers the following advantages:
