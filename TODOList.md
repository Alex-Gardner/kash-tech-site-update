Mobile Nav UNDER header
Nav menu should disappear after clicking a link
Should offset "X" distance from the top
Close button on nav overlay?
Need a writeup on databricks service
Partner buttons change display state on hover
"Hover" (mouseenter) Effects on partner program removed. Seemingly creates bad UX
Give the buttons active state based on selected company

\*\*\* 208: took of abs position \***\*\*\*\*** Any transform value on a parent (other than revert) causes the absolutely positioned element to select that as a new "positioned" parent

Nav items summary color change

Simple Details/summary elements working on desktop resolution

Change partner program to just "partners"

Add event listener for clicks outside the details element to close the active details element

Media query in JS for mouseenter and mouseleave events

Visible:
focus-within
hover(mouseenter)

Not visible:
mouseleave
blur

1. on mouseenter, clear all open detail elements -- then make the current one visible
1. on mouseleave, clear all open detail elements

[Nice to have: Learn with Jason Blend Effects](https://codepen.io/jlengstorf/pen/BambbKa)

Smooth scrolling behavior: works as intended on firefox (scrolls to links within a page are smooth. Links outside of pages are instant)

If we had a redo--
people, process, technology: images in HTML (aspect ratio 1, border-radius 50% -- or clip-path, idk)
"Process" gets pulled in as an svg image

Hash links scroll the top of the screen to the top of the link in question - the header appears /over/ the link content we wish to see.
