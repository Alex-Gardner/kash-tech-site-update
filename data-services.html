                        Is your company struggling with achieving your digital transformation goals?  KASH Tech starts at the beginning to ensure that you have a solid data integration foundation. Kash Tech believes that data integration is platform independent, and must have the capacity to integrate data regardless of the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                            These products are built to move large data volumes while offering the capability to carry out effective transformations. They are often found in a batch process algorithm. This is due to the availability of data volumes and the frequently used transformations like summation, aggregation, sorts and multi-table joins.

                            These are often known as brokers or messaging software. These are designed in such a way that they move a smaller amount of data with amplified frequency patterns.

                            These products present information when data sets are modified or changed. These are delta-processing or change-data capture products. They often work on either a triggering or log-scraping mechanism. Also, they offer a pointer to the last extraction point for tracking the data that has been processed.

                    <p>
                        Data modeling is the process of developing a visual representation of the data while showing the interdependencies between data points.  This is the precursor to the development of physical data model required to support the defined application solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of data modeling, the different types of data used, relationship between the data points, and data grouping and organizing is displayed clearly.  Business requirements are the guidelines around which data modeling is done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the initial stages of an application development project, data is clearly defined and organized in a logical structure. Following this, the data modeling steps are executed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of data modeling, the type of application to be constructed for the specific business problem is identified. Some of the parameters to be considered while deciding on the type of model includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        A modern data architecture creates a foundation that enhances the access to – and extends the usage of – the large and disparate data stores from traditional and non-traditional sources.

                        To overcome these common obstacles that are created from rigid and aging data silos, we design and build secure and adaptable architectures:

                    <p>
                        Data Virtualization represents the most modern approach to data integration.  It establishes a new benchmark for fast, efficient, and effective access to the disparate and distributed data sources within your organization.  Unlike ETL solutions, which require data replication, data virtualization simply reveals an integrated view of all your business data to the appropriate users.  There is no “forklifting” of data from one source to another.  On a real-time basis, and reacting to the requests of your decision makers, data virtualization retrieves the data from its original source.  Data virtualization proves that connecting data is far superior to collecting it.
